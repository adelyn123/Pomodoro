## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Work Session** (25 minutes): Focus on a single task
2. **Short Break** (5 minutes): Take a quick break
3. **Repeat** 4 work sessions
4. **Long Break** (15 minutes): Take a longer break
5. **Start Over**: Begin the cycle again

## Browser Compatibility

This timer works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 Classes
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Web Audio API (for notifications)
